# Take home assignment for Bongo Media
First of all, thank you for taking the time to check out my work! I completed this project as a web deployment using React.
# Running this project

## Clone the project to your local system
### `git clone https://github.com/coreymaroney/BongoMedia.git`
## Navigate into  the project repository using
### `cd BongoMedia`
## Install the dependencies

### `npm install`

## Run the web deployment
### `npm start`

Your preferred web browser _should_ automatically open the project at this point. If it didn't, navigate to `localhost:3000` on your web browser. (Ironically, based on our last conversation about shaping your users) Please use Google Chrome for the best optimization.
